# White Nights by Fyodor Dostoevsky

Of my most recent readings, *White Nights* was one of the most influential short stories, which I feel is the best way I can express how a lonely person can romanticize life. The story begins with an unnamed Dreamer who is narrating to us about a girl he met in St. Petersburg on one night and then on other consequential nights. Owing to his loneliness, he is instantly attracted to her, not because of her beauty or anything else, but out of nowhere she feels safe and soft. However, this also keeps him frozen in place, living in imagined worlds instead of the real one.

The Dreamer is sincere in his love for the girl he met, and it shows that love is not always mutual. The Dreamer listens, supports, and sacrifices, yet still is not worthy of her, so this story tells us that goodness is not a currency that buys affection. He is kind to the girl and very generous and also shows empathy, but that does not obligate Nastenka to return his love. The only concept behind writing this novel is that Fyodor Dostoevsky wants us to know that love does not follow moral fairness.

Another great lesson I have learned from it is that imagination is a nice refuge, but it is a slow trap. Dostoevsky shows how dreaming too much can become a way of avoiding life rather than preparing for it. When a person expects things that might not become true, or when his imagination does not come true, we are left in much more despair than we already were.

And also, sometimes some people enter our lives just to show our good side, that we are worthy of being affectionately admired, loved, and felt. Nastenka is not his ending, but she proves that his heart is alive. Hence, our Dreamer is not feeling bad but is happy. Sometimes we meet people as a whole new connection which is temporary, yet we learn a whole new purpose of our life.

This novel shows that happiness can exist in small moments, and it also strengthens my belief in not controlling others but letting them live as they want. It is one of the finest characteristics I have learned from my readings. The more you let go of others, the more your heart is free of needs. Do not be attached to someone, nor make them attached to you.

And finally, Dostoevsky suggests that even brief joy is still real joy. As the Dreamer says, *“My God, a whole moment of happiness. Is that too little for the whole of a man’s life?”*

I recommend you give this short story a read. I have intentionally not told you how the Dreamer madly expresses himself and shows his vulnerable side to this new girl just because he is unable to control it, and that teaches us how vulnerable we are to our feelings, especially when we are alone. So what are you waiting for? Go read it now.
